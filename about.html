          <p>Reference Librarian</p>
          <p>I began working at PTC in 2017 as a part-time librarian and went full-time about a year later. I work with the serials (journals, newspapers, and magazines) in terms of ordering and checking them into the catalog, and I handle interlibrary loan requests for books through Access Pennsylvania. I assist students, staff, and faculty with finding information. I also conduct library orientation sessions for new faculty and for classes (per the instructor’s request). </p>
          <p>Before working at PTC, I was a Learning Resources Center Manager at Strayer University at both the Robinson Township and Cranberry Township campuses, from 2009 to 2016, where my responsibilities were similar.</p>
          <p>Prior to working at Strayer University, I worked at the State Library of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg for a couple of years where approximately 40% of my time I worked as a reference librarian at Main Reference and Law Reference desks, and 60% of my time I worked as a Document Delivery Librarian (Interlibrary Loan). </p>
          <p>Interesting fact: Many years ago (Clinton administration), when I worked for Battelle Memorial Institute, I and others went to Los Alamos as part of a project to help DOE with setting up procedures for identifying and analyzing documents related to <a href="https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/human-radiation-experiments" target="_blank"> human radiation experiments</a> that occurred starting in the 1940s. It was interesting to see how societal ideas changed over the past few decades, especially regarding informed consent, and how we’ve moved from accepting medical advice at face value to wanting a more active role in our health care decisions. </p>
