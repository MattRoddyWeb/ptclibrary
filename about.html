          <p>Library Coordinator</p>
          <p>With a freshly earned bachelor’s in journalism from Pace University, I followed the call of the lights on Broadway and moved to New York City.  Over the years I earned membership in all the professional acting unions.  It opened doors to better productions, but casting calls remained the same.  Realizing I spent more time as an unemployed actress than an employed one, I moved to Yugoslavia.  An unconventional reaction to my situation to be sure, but once again I found myself being called to something more in life; something different.  I spent the next years working with travel agencies, transforming tourists into pilgrims as they made their way to Medjugorje, current day Bosnia Hercegovina.  In 1991, when the country was torn apart by civil war, and all the borders were closed, foreign governments brokered an escape route to free their citizens before it was too late.  I was part of this evacuation.  I found myself on the last ferry out of Montenegro headed to Bari, Italy.  Some moments in life leave an indelible mark.  This was one of them.  I remember the crowds, the abandoned vehicles filled with personal belongings, as there was only room on the ferry for people.  It took three months to make my way back to the United States.  I enrolled in the Theology program at Franciscan University, earning a Masters.  Upon graduation I continued at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, in Rome, earning a Licentiate in Spiritual Theology.  I am qualified to teach Spiritual Theology at a seminary level.  I came to Pittsburgh Technical College in 2002, as a library cataloger.  And now, 19 years later, I am the Library Coordinator.  I met St. Pope John Paul II, in 1997, and admired his leadership style of servant-leader.  The principle that one leads by serving, guides the course of my days.

          </p>

            Every war and evacuations return me to my time in Europe.  May this country never know this pain</p>

          <p>Reference Librarian</p>
          <p>I began working at PTC in 2017 as a part-time librarian and went full-time about a year later. I work with the serials (journals, newspapers, and magazines) in terms of ordering and checking them into the catalog, and I handle interlibrary loan requests for books through Access Pennsylvania. I assist students, staff, and faculty with finding information. I also conduct library orientation sessions for new faculty and for classes (per the instructor’s request). </p>
          <p>Before working at PTC, I was a Learning Resources Center Manager at Strayer University at both the Robinson Township and Cranberry Township campuses, from 2009 to 2016, where my responsibilities were similar.</p>
          <p>Prior to working at Strayer University, I worked at the State Library of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg for a couple of years where approximately 40% of my time I worked as a reference librarian at Main Reference and Law Reference desks, and 60% of my time I worked as a Document Delivery Librarian (Interlibrary Loan). </p>
          <p>Interesting fact: Many years ago (Clinton administration), when I worked for Battelle Memorial Institute, I and others went to Los Alamos as part of a project to help DOE with setting up procedures for identifying and analyzing documents related to <a href="https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/human-radiation-experiments" target="_blank"> human radiation experiments</a> that occurred starting in the 1940s. It was interesting to see how societal ideas changed over the past few decades, especially regarding informed consent, and how we’ve moved from accepting medical advice at face value to wanting a more active role in our health care decisions. </p>
